While it's possible to write everything yourself, most of the time you'll want to build on code other people have created. Software development kits (SDKs) make this process much easier. In this course, senior technical course developer Sasha Vodnik gives you a first step into the practical applications of working with SDKs. Find out how to select an SDK and explore different SDK features. Learn how to configure SDK tools, troubleshoot issues, and write code using an SDK. Plus, dive into ways you can use an SDK in programming.
